For today:

Find a way to indicate an individual has more than one trees.->Done
Find a way to "define" those trees.->Done!!!!

The idea is figuring out how does a function set work and if it's going to help me "defining" the trees.

Each GPTree subscribes to a GPFunctionSet which defines the GPNodes legally permitted in the tree. GPFunctionSets store, in a variety of redundant tables, the relevant GPNodes. When an algorithm needs to generate a tree, it does so by finding the appropriate GPFunctionSet choosing GPNodes from the set, and cloning them to produce nodes to hang in the tree. How do I indicate the GPFunction associated to which GPTree??? -->> In the conf file





We're running
Let's expect the worst


no build plan 
still, it doesn't crash
neither builds anything


OMg, it's running

HOLY SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET

Those are a lot of nodes


OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
IT WORKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

HOPE
ESPOIRU

Still...
too many nodes
