Hi!
I'm starting this bot as a
final career project.

I'm not so good at Genetic
Programing, and ecj.

Let's take a look at some methods
from Problem.

Let's launch this shit!

Chaoslauncher is opening StarCraft
It usually takes from 30 sec 
to 60 secs.

There we go.

Gotta go fast.

I want to know if a method gets called
and how it behaves when the game ends.

Whoops

That is... unexpected

Maybe I left the sleep method on
nope
I just broke something xD

This mess is the "bot"
It's from the tutorial+the ecj
tutorial.
I've just fused them together

Damn, this looks terrible.

Let's go full diogenes
And debug using system prints
Niiiiiiiiice

Ecj is running, partially


I should have gone here


I'm looking at the shutting down

HAhahaha
I knew
It was one of my first problems




YOLO

Let's watch them die.
And see if they exit properly.
I'm (how do you say it..)
Considering concurrency



guess today is not my day

okay
break point time


not sure if Stacraft will help
But Windows already f**




great

it wasn't a great idea to start with



oh god



wait for death

So let's consider concurrency

This can only be either great 
or terrible
I'm guessing terrible




NOW this is a wild guess
by that point game shouldn't exist or
is already ended and you
cannot pause it.

Let's give it a chance before
I go to bed, damn it

Interesting
Not as expected 
But if I wasn't so bad it'll work
















Let's call it a day
Or not
Bye
