Helloooo

Yesterday I tried to make this big gpnode called CollectMinerals.

I thought I had to write every single type of data as a GPData. I was wrong. I'm glad I was wrong.

Finally, after some... time I launched both game and bot. But it failed, just when I stopped streaming I realized I had 2 things wrong, let see them:

1st THERE'S ALWAYS A CONFIGURATION FILE

2nd The GPData type GameData was instantiated but it was null as it is "completely" setted when a game starts, no when I call the problem.
I set an event that gets triggered when gimmeIt is called in TestBot1.


Let's see it running
It should be collecting minerals.

Waiting for BW to open


Btw, I was thinking about making a co-existing GP.
That means two GP generated bots will be fighting.

Well, that's working.
+1

Let's write more macros.
Man, alll those debuging prints

This is a training macro
Let's train marines
Sounds like a plan


But first, let's build the barracks



Copypasting, what could go wrong?




I'm guessing it's all set


I'm not seeing barracks

:(

Why u not building?


I guess because I have many terminals


???
I'll put 5 children for the moment




No, you're not building barracks, you liar

At least it's having more nodes



Let's see if it's going slower now



WOAH, my cpu is at 93%
whoops


OMG
Finally!!!!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
IT'S ALIVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Buring the CPU!!!!!!























GG







The proof of concept is done.
