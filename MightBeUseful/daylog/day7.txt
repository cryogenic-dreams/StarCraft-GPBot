OK, time has come
It's time to make a tech tree
Using grammar

#wikipedia is your friend
#do i need an erc as supply?
#erc is Ephemeral Random Constant
#i'm guessing it's a yes
oh yes


Yeap, basically, we'll operate our build plan with supply (not time, because, the game is gonna be fasssst)

i need like 34634343 gpnodes


ok, i'll have finished before the next stream a working script that writes all those tiring GPnodes and also adds the parameters to the params file

ah
almost forgot
I'll upload it to github

finally...(shame to me)

and, that's all I guess

Bye
